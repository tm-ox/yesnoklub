Nusasonic is a multi-year project that plunges into a broad spectrum of experimental sound and music cultures in Southeast Asia, enabling dialogue within the region, with Europe, and the rest of the world.

To date through the Nusasonic project Yes No Klub has organised a five day, multiple venue festival in Yogyakarta with participants from throughout Southeast Asia and Europe in 2018. In 2019 Yes No Klub also hosted a two month Nusasonic residency for <a href="https://nadahelshazly.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Nadah El Shazly</a> (Cairo) and <a href="https://www.jessicaekomane.com/" target="_blank">Jessica Ekomane</a> (Berlin). The residency involved workshops, discussions, performances and collaborative projects with local artists / musicians and communities.

In February of 2020 Yes No Klub furthered its international network through a collaboration with HuruHara for the inclusion of four Indonesian artists in the <a href="https://www.asiatopa.com.au/" target="_blank">AsiaTopa Festival</a> in Melbourne, Australia.

The event involved two weeks of performances, collaborations and exploration which has resulted in on-going working relations between Indonesian and Australian participants.
