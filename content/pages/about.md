Yes No Klub (YNK) is an official host organisation for <a href="https://asialink.unimelb.edu.au/" target="_blank">AsiaLink</a> (Australia) in Indonesia and co-manages an ongoing project with the German cultural centre <a href="https://www.goethe.de/ins/id/en/index.html" target="_blank">Goethe-Institute</a>, Germany's <a href="https://www.ctm-festival.de/" target="_blank">CTM Festival</a> for Adventurous Music and Art, Singapore's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/playfreelyexperiment" target="_blank">Playfreely / Blackkaji</a> and Manila's <a href="https://www.wsk.io/" target="_blank">WSK Festival</a> entitled <a href="http://www.nusasonic.com/" target="_blank">Nusasonic</a>.

Nusasonic is a multi-year project that plunges into a broad spectrum of experimental sound and music cultures in Southeast Asia, enabling dialogue within the region, with Europe, and the rest of the world.

To date through the Nusasonic project YNK has organised a five day, multiple venue festival in Yogyakarta with participants from throughout Southeast Asia and Europe in 2018. In 2019 YNK also hosted a two month Nusasonic residency for <a href="https://nadahelshazly.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Nadah El Shazly</a> (Cairo) and <a href="https://www.jessicaekomane.com/" target="_blank">Jessica Ekomane</a> (Berlin). The residency involved workshops, discussions, performances and collaborative projects with local artists / musicians and communities.

In February of 2020 YNK furthered its international network through a collaboration with HuruHara for the inclusion of four Indonesian artists in the <a href="https://www.asiatopa.com.au/" target="_blank">AsiaTopa Festival</a> in Melbourne, Australia. The event involved two weeks of performances, collaborations and exploration which has resulted in on-going working relations between Indonesian and Australian participants.

Since Covid YNK has shifted its focus to the curation of content for external events. In 2022 YNK is working with a number of events and festivals, most notably <a href="https://www.artjog.id/" target="_blank">ArtJog</a> and the facilitation of a stage at <a href="https://pestapora.com" target="_blank">Pestapora</a> with artists from throughout Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines.
